    <h1>PULSES</h1>
    <img src="PULSES1.png" alt="">
    <h2>Sowing</h2>
    <p>In almost all the pulse crops, we may go for drilling or dibbling method of sowing method. The seeds are sown at a depth of 5 to 7 cm below the soil.</p>
    <h2>Seed treatment</h2>
    <p>Rhizobium 200 gm + PSB 250 gm /10kg of seed.  Seed treatment with (Carbendazim 1 gm+ Thiram 1.5 gm) per kg of seed. Greengram blackgram  under intensive cropping should be treated with Carbofuran @ 0.2% one week before Rhizobium treatment against Root knot  and Reniform nematode.</p>
    <h2>Fertilizer dose</h2>
    <p>20:40:20 NPK kg/ha along with 20 kg S/ha greatly increases yield of pulses and also benefit the succeeding crop. Among the micro nutrients Zn is the most deficient nutrient. So the application of Zn @ 25 kg/ha as basal gives very promising results.  Boron and Molybdenum gives better results in acid soil.
Foliar spray of 2% DAP and 2% KCl at Pre flowering stage enhances the yield.
</p>
    <h2>Irrigation</h2>
    <p>The pulse crops in Rabi and Pre rabi seasons are mostly grown on residual soil moisture condition. However irrigation should be provided at critical growth stage i.e flowering and pod development stage.</p>
    <h2>Plant protection</h2>
    <p>The major diseases are yellow mosaic in northern plains and powdery mildew in southern and south-eastern regions (in rabi). To control insect and pest, yellow mosaic virus, application of Phorate in soil before or at sowing @ 1 kg/ha is required. <br>
1.	Pod borer- spray Triazophos/ Monocrotophus @ 2 ml/ ltr of water, Carbaryl@ 2 kg/ha <br>
2.	Aphids- Spray methyl dementon 25 EC @ 1000 ml/ha <br>
3.	White fly -Spray the crop with Imidacloprid @ 1 ml/3.5 ltrs of water/Flonicamid-200gm/Ha
</p>
    <h2>Crop duration</h2>
    <p>Since pulses are indeterminate growth habit and continue to produce new flashes the top dressing will be done on 40-45 days after sowing. The crop complete its first flesh of matured pods during 60-65th day, further their second new flesh within 20-25 days.</p>
<h2>Harvesting, Threshing & Storage</h2>
<p>Urd should be harvested when 70-80 % pods matured and most of the pods turn black. Over maturity may result in shattering. Harvested crop should be dried on threshing floor for few days and then threshed. Threshing can be done either manually or by trampling under the feet of bullocks. The clean seeds should be sun dried for 3 - 4 days to bring their moisture content at 8-10% to safely store in appropriate bins.
A well managed crop of Urd may produce 12 - 1 5 quintals grains/ha .
