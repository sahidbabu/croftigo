    <h2>SOWING</h2>
    <p><strong>Time of sowing</strong><br>
The ideal time for raising nursery is from October end to mid of November. Cover the nursery area with 50 % shade net and cover the sides using 40 / 50 mesh insect proof nylon net. Seedlings are ready for transplantation in 30-40 days (Usually in February - March).
</p>
<p><strong>Spacing</strong><br>
Use row to row spacing of 75 cm and plant to plant spacing of 45 cm.
</p>
<p><strong>Method of sowing</strong><br>
Transplantation method is used.
</p>
    <h2>SEED</h2>
    <p><strong>Seed Rate</strong><br>
For varieties use seed rate of 200 gm/acre and 80-100 gm/acre for hybrids.
</p>
<p><strong>Seed Treatment</strong><br>
To protect crop from various soil borne disease seed treatment is necessary. Before sowing do seed treatment with Thiram@3gm or Carbendazim@2gm/kg. After chemical treatment, treat seed with Trichoderma@5gm/kg or Pseudomonas fluorescens@10gm/kg. Keep it in shade and use it for sowing. Do watering with rosecan on daily basis. Drench the nursery with Copper oxychloride@2.5gm/ltr of water at 15days interval to prevent crop from damping off disease.

To protect against wilt, sucking pest, dip roots for 15 min in Trichoderma harzianum@20gm/Ltr+0.5ml/Ltr Imidacloprid before transplanting. Seedling inoculation with VAM supplemented with nitrogen fixing bacteria, save super phosphate by 50% along with saving of 25% nitrogen application.
</p>
<h4>For seed treatment use any one fungicide from the following:</h4>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Fungicide name</th>
    <th>Quantity (Dosage per kg seed)</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Carbendazim</td>
    <td>2 gm</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>Thiram</td>
  <td>3 gm</td>

        <th>NITROGEN</th>

    </table>
    <p>Apply Nitrogen@25kg in form of Urea@55kg/acre, Phosphorus@12kg in form of Single Super Phosphate@75kg and Potash@12kg in form of MOP (Muriate of Potash)@20kg/acre. Apply half dose of Nitrogen and full dose of Phosphorus and Potash at time of transplanting. Apply remaining amount of nitrogen after first picking. <br>
Also to obtain high yield take spray of MAP 12:61:00@75gm/15Ltr water at 40-45 days after transplanting at branch growing stage. To Increase yield along with to obtain more no of pickings, apply sulphur/Bensulf@10kg/acre and spray Calcium Nitrate@10gm/Ltr water in flowering stage.<br>
<strong>Water Soluble Fertilizer:</strong> 10-15 days after transplantation, sprayed 19:19:19 with micronutrients@2.5-3gm/Ltr of water. Then after 40-45 days spraying of 20% Boron@1gm+Micronutrients@2.5-3gm/Ltr of water should be done. When crop is in flowering stage sprayed 0:52:34@4-5gm+micronutrients@2.5-3gm/Ltr of water. In fruiting stage sprayed 0:52:34@4-5gm+Boron@1gm/Ltr of water. When crop is fruit formation stage sprayed 13:0:45@4-5gm+Calcium nitrate@2-2.5gm/Ltr of water.<br>

<strong>Growth regulators:</strong>To control flower drop and to get good quality fruit, take spray of NAA (naphthalene acetic acid)@4ml/15 ltr of water at flower initiation stage. Care during flowering & fruit set gives upto 20% more yield. Spray Homobrassinalide@5ml/10Ltr of water at flowering thrice at 15 days gap. To increase fruit set having good quality. Spray Triacontanol growth regulator at 1.25ppm(1.25ml/Ltr) on 20,40,60 and 80th day of planting.

</p>
    <h2>IRRIGATION</h2>
    <p>It cant withstand heavy moisture so apply irrigation only when needed. Heavy irrigation causes lanky vegetative growth and flower drop. Number of irrigation and interval of irrigation depend on soil and climatic condition. If plant show dropping at 4 pm, it is indication of plant needed irrigation. Flowering and fruit development are most critical stages of water requirement. Stagnation of water should not be allowed in nursery and field as it causes fungal infection.</p>
    <h2>PLANT PROTECTION</h2>
    <p>â€¢<strong>	Pest and their control</strong> <br>
<strong>Fruit borer: </strong>Caterpillar eat leaves of crop afterward they enter into fruit and caused heavy loss in yield management. Collect and destroyed damaged fruits and grown up caterpillars. Set up pheromone traps for Helicoverpa armigera or Spodoptera litura at 5 Nos./acre.<br>

To control pod borers apply poison bait balls made up of bran-5 kg, Carbaryl-500 gm, Jaggery-500 gm and sufficient amount of water. If infestation of fruit borers is observed. spray Chlorpyrifos + Cypermethrin (Nurel-D/Amla) @30 ml+Teepol@0.5 ml in 12 Ltr of water with power sprayer. Spray with Emamectin benzoate 5% SG @4 gm/10 Ltr of water or Flubendiamide 20 WDG@6 gm/10 litre of water.
</p>
    <h2>HARVESTING</h2>
    <p>Chilly can be harvested green or left to ripen on the plant. The ripened colour will depend on the variety grown. To increases no. of pickings, Spray Urea@10gm/Ltr and Soluble K@10gm/Ltr (1% solution each) with 15 days interval during harvesting time. For canning purpose they are harvested when fruits are of red color. Chilly use for drying purpose is harvested at full ripe stage.</p>
    <h2>POST-HARVEST</h2>
    <p>This include 1) Drying 2) Grading and Packing 3) Storage</p>
