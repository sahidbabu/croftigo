<h2>SOIL</h2>
<p>It can grow on variety of soils but it gives good result when grown on sandy loam and silt loam soils. Also soils should be rich in nitrogen, potassium also rich in organic matter content. For good growth, ideal pH of soil should be in range of 6 to 6.8. Avoid waterlogged, acidic soils for cultivation.</p>
<h2>LAND PREPARATION</h2>
<p>Plough land for two-three times and bring soil to fine tilth. Carry out soil testing to check nutritional status of soil. If soil is deficient in nutrients apply micro-nutrients on basis of soil test results.</p>
<h2>SOWING</h2>
<p><strong>Time of sowing</strong><br>
Prepare nursery in the month of mid-September to mid-November. Sow seeds in nursery at a distance of 15-20 cm. It takes 3-4 days for germination of seeds. After germinations, lettuce required sunlight for minimum 3-4 hours per day in morning. When seedlings become four to six weeks old, transplant them into main field.<br>

<strong>Spacing</strong><br>
When seedling are transplanted in main field, use row to row spacing of 45 cm and plant to plant distance of 30 cm.<br>

<strong>Sowing Depth</strong><br>
Depth should be 2-4 cm.<br>
<strong>Method of Sowing</strong><br>
For sowing of lettuce use transplanting method.
</p>
<h2>SEED</h2>
<p><strong>Seed Rate</strong><br>
To raise seedlings for 1 acre, sow 400gm seeds in 2 marla. Irrigate nursery beds at interval of week.
</p>

<p>Apply well decomposed cow dung@15 ton per acre, and Nitrogen@25 kg (in form of Urea@55 kg), Phosphorus@12 kg (in form of Super Phosphate@75 kg) per acre. Apply whole amount of phosphorus and half amount of nitrogen before transplantation. Give remaining amount of nitrogen six weeks after transplantation.</p>
<h2>IRRIGATION</h2>
<p>48 hours before transplantation stop irrigating nursery beds. 30 minutes before transplantation apply good amount of irrigation. It will help in easy pulling of seedlings. Provide first irrigation, immediately after transplantation. Apply remaining irrigation, at interval of 5-6 days on light soils whereas 8 to 10 days irrigation interval for heavy soils.</p>
<h2>PLANT PROTECTION</h2>
<p><strong>Pest and their control:</strong><br>
<strong>Aphid: </strong>If incidence of sucking pest like aphid is observed to control take spray of Imidacloprid 17.8SL@60 ml/acre using 150 ltr water.<br>
<strong>Disease and their control:</strong>
<strong>Downy Mildew and Mosaic:</strong> Use resistant variety for control of downy mildew. Mosaic is seed borne disease so as a preventive measure use disease free seeds for cultivation of lettuce.
</p>
<h2>HARVESTING</h2>
<p>Loose leaf type variety is harvested when they are fully developed or reached to marketable size. Tender leaves are cut regularly with interval of one week. At the end of March or at beginning of April stop harvesting of leaves as plant attain milky stage. For seed purpose complete harvesting in May month. It gives average seed yield of 50 kg/acre.

For head type variety, carry out harvesting when heads are fully developed. Harvesting can be done by hand or by cutting of plant just above soil surface.

Carry out harvesting early in morning. It will keep leaves fresh.
</p>
<h2>POST-HARVEST</h2>
<p>After harvesting, do sorting and grading of leaves according head size, leaves size etc. After then lettuce is packed in crates or cartons. Lettuce can be stored for three weeks at temperature of 4 to 5Â°C at 95% relative humidity.</p>
