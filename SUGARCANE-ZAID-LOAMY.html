<h2>Land preparion</h2>
<p>Soil should be ploughed using different tractor-drawn implements to obtain optimum soil tilth and prepare the ridges and furrows.</p>
<h2>Seedling</h2>
<p>Under paired-row planting, 24,000 (2-budded setts) or 16,000 (3-budded setts) plants are required for planting 1 acre of land. Row to row spacing varies 90–120 cm depending on the soil texture.</p>
<h2>irrigation</h2>
<p>Sugarcane requires regular irrigation at different stages. Provide shallow wetting with 2–3 cm depth of water at shorter intervals in the initial stage. During the later stages of tillering, grand growth and maturity phases, the irrigation intervals can be increased to 8–10 days.
Irrigation of sugarcane crop through drip system with fertiliser nutrient solutions (fertigation) could be adopted so that water as well as crop nutrition requirements could be met together.
</p>
<h2>Weed Management</h2>
<p>•	Regular intercultural operations including digging of ridges with a spade; 30, 60 and 90 days after planting <br>
•	Spraying of herbicide Atrazine (0.8 kg/ac) or Oxyflurofen (300 ml/ac) mixed in water (600 l/ha) as a pre-emergence herbicide on the third day of planting <br>
•	Post emergence directed spray application of glyphosate (1 l/ac) along with 2% ammonium sulphate or 2,4-D sodium salt (1 kg/ac) mixed in water (600 l/ha). <br>
•	If the parasitic weed striga is a problem, post-emergence application of 2,4-D sodium salt (kg/ha) mixed in water (500 l/ha) may be done.
</p>
<h2>Insect Pests & Pest Management</h2>
<h3>1.	Early shoot borer Management</h3>
<p>o	Use resistant varieties & Intercropping of sugarcane with Daincha <br>
o	Trash mulching along the ridges to a thickness of 10-15 cm <br>
o	Removal and destruction of dead hearts. Install pheromone traps @ 10Nos. /ha <br>
o	Soil application of insecticides Carboryl +Sevidol 4% G 12.5 kg/ha, Carbofuron 3G 33 kg/ha or Spraying of Chlorpyriphos 1000 ml/ha.
</p>
<h3>2.	White Grub Management</h3>
<p>o	Provide adequate irrigation. <br>
o	Deep ploughing immediately after harvesting. <br>
o	Stagnating water for 24hrs in the field makes the grub come out from the soil. <br>
o	Collection and destruction the adult beetles <br>
</p>
<h3>3.	Sugarcane Wholly Aphid</h3>
<p>o	Paired row system of planting. <br>
o	Rapping of canes all along the rows. <br>
o	Dipping of the seed sets in Chlorpyripos 20 EC solution (2 ml/lit) before planting. <br>
o	Soil application of phorate 10 G @ 5kg/ac or spraying of Acephate 75 SP @1g/lit or Chlorpyriphos 20 EC @ 2 ml/lit or Oxydemeton methyl 25 EC @ 1.3 ml/lit, <br>
</p>
<h2>Plant Diseases & Disease Management</h2>
<p>Fungus, bacteria and virus cause diseases to sugarcane crop. Some of the diseases of sugarcane crop and their suggested control measures are listed below</p>
<h3>1.	Red rot disease – Management</h3>
<p>o	Dipping of seedsets in 0.25% solution of Agallol or Aretan for 2-3 minutes<br>
o	Uproot the infected plants and burn them
</p>
<h3>2.	Smut – Management</h3>
<p>o	Sowing of resistant varieties.<br>
o	Carefully cut down the apex of the plant in such a way that spores do not spread and burn it out along with the uprooted affected plant.
</p>
<h3>3.	Wilt – Management</h3>
<p>•	Early varieties have to be harvested at 10 to 11 months age.<br>
•	Mid-season varieties at 11 to 12 months
•	Harvest the cane at peak maturity<br>
•	Cut the cane to the ground level for both plant and ratoon crops<br>
</p>
<h2>Harvesting & Post Harvest Measures</h2>
<p>•	Early varieties have to be harvested at 10 to 11 months age.<br>
•	Mid-season varieties at 11 to 12 months<br>
•	Harvest the cane at peak maturity<br>
•	Cut the cane to the ground level for both plant and ratoon crops<br>
