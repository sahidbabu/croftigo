    <h1>COTTON CULTIVATION</h1>
    <img src="cotton1.jpg" alt="">
    <p>Cotton plant is a shrub and is widely cultivated in over 90 countries for its fiber and secondly for seeds. About 2,5% of world cropland is planted with cotton. It is an angiosperm, dicotyledonous plant, which belongs to the family of Malvaceae. It is native to Asia and Africa.  Exactly as it happens with tomatoes, peppers and other plants, cotton is natively a perennial plant, but nowadays we cultivate it as annual. This means that we sow the seeds during spring, we harvest the cotton during autumn, and then we plow and destroy the plants, so that we can sow again next spring in an empty field.</p>
<h2>How to sow cotton – Cotton Seeding Rate- Number of Cotton Plants per hectare</h2>
<p>Cotton seed is one of the most important parameters for a good yield. Only certified seeds should be preferred, while seeds older than 2 years should be avoided.
We sow cotton seeds directly in the field with special sowing machines. These machines open small trenches (of a predefined depth) for the seeds, drop the seeds inside at certain distances between them and then cover lightly with soil. In most cases, these machines also drop a predefined quantity of fertilizer granules between the seeds. We add on average 55 lbs. (25 kg) of cotton seeds and 440 lbs. (200 kg) of fertilizer per hectare inside the sowing machine (1 hectare = 10.000 square meters = 2,47 acres). The sowing depth is 1,5 – 2 inches (4-5 cm). We leave an average distance of 3 ft (0,91 m) between rows, so as to facilitate the mechanical harvest. In the sowing line, we sow the seeds leaving an average distance of 3 inches (7,62 cm) between them. On average, we have around 90.000-100.000 plants per hectare. Consequently, the average number of cotton plants per acre is 40.000. However, there are cases in which we can have up to 70.000 cotton plants per acre, but this can be achieved only by selecting specific varieties.

<h2>Cotton Plant Pollination</h2>

<p>Some cotton plants are self-fertile and self-pollinating, while others need pollinators. Theoretically, the average self-pollinating cotton plant does not need bees in order to pollinate and produce fiber or seeds. However, it has been estimated that the visits of bees to all cotton plants (self-fertile or not) increase final fiber production by at least 10% in weight, while the quantity of seed production also increases. Each cotton plant can only be pollinated on average for just one day, the day when the flower is open. Consequently, placing 1-2 healthy beehives per 1 hectare of cotton crop (1 hectare = 10.000 square meters = 2,47 acres) during the exact period of flowering (summer) has been found to be beneficial in some cases. However, in many areas, placing on purpose beehives inside the cotton field is not necessary, as honeybees are naturally attracted to the cotton plant, and can travel from miles away in order to forage and collect its pollen.

<h2>How to fertilize Cotton Plants</h2>
<p>As it happens in every other crop, there can’t be any universal fertilization scheme, because every field is different and has different needs. Performing soil analysis once a year is extremely important in order to diagnose nutrient deficiencies and take corrective actions, under the guidance of a licensed agronomist. However, we will list the most commonly used methods regarding cotton plants fertilization.
As a first rule of thumb, cotton plant consumes Nitrogen (N) at a double quantity compared to Phosphorus (P) and Potassium (K). Consequently, a N-P-K 20-10-10 fertilizer is more suitable, if a soil analysis is impossible. A common fertilization schedule applied by many cotton growers is adding 440 lbs. (200 kg) of N-P-K 20-10-10 per hectare during sowing (through the sowing machine), and 440 lbs. (200 kg) of N-P-K 20-10-10 per hectare during flowering (early summer). Keep in mind that 1 hectare = 10.000 square meters = 2,47 acres.
Another common fertilization scheme is adding 550 lbs. (250 kg) of ammonium nitrate, 400 lbs. (181 kg) of N-P-K 0-46-0 and 400 lbs. (181 kg) of N-P-K 0-0-50 per hectare throughout the year. These quantities are normally spread in 8 equal applications, with the first being after sowing and the last around 6 weeks after flowering. However, these are just common patterns that should not be followed without making your own research and soil analysis.
In other cases, farmers prefer foliar applications of KNO3 once a week after the first flower appears. Foliar applications can provide fertilizers and insecticides at the same time, and thus reduce labor costs.

<h2>How to irrigate cotton plants – Cotton Irrigation</h2>
<p>As a rule of thumb, cotton plant needs a minimum of 500 mm of water between germination and boll formation. A great percentage of US cotton is produced in non-irrigated fields. However, growing commercially cotton plants without providing artificial water supply is not an easy task. The problem is not that the cotton plant needs water in order to thrive, but the fact that it needs water at very specific periods during its development. If you choose to rely solely on rainfalls, your production is at risk and the chances are that it will fluctuate over the years.
In areas with no adequate winter rainfalls, farmers irrigate well the fields before sowing. In most cases, farmers do not irrigate often in the period between the sowing and blooming. Once the plants bloom, cotton growers begin to irrigate more often, every 5-7 days, depending on other parameters. In about 140 days after planting or 45 days after bolls appear, the cotton boll will begin to naturally split open along the bolls segments and start to dry out. At that period (around late summer), many farmers stop the irrigation (or irrigate lightly just once every two weeks), so as to help the cotton dry out easier. Drip irrigation is mostly used in cotton fields, but there are other methods as well (flooding, center pivots etc.).

<h2>Cotton Harvest & Yields</h2>
<p>5,5 to 6,5 months after sowing, cotton is normally ready to be harvested. As it happens in any other crop, knowing exactly which day to harvest requires years of experience. We harvest during autumn (September – October in most areas of US) with cotton harvesting machines. These machines are typically very big tractors that strip the fibers from the plants and collect the bolls. Immediately after the harvest, it is good to destroy the remaining of cotton plants with a shredder and then make a very good plowing of our field.
On average, we can harvest from 2 to 4 tons (4400 to 8800 lbs.) of cotton per hectare, or 0,8 to 1,6 tons (1760 to 3527 lbs.) per acre. Keep in mind that 1 ton = 1000 kg = 2.200 lbs. and 1 hectare = 2,47 acres = 10.000 square meters. What we harvest from the field is called unginned cotton and it does not represent a traded product. We have to give cotton to a cotton ginner, which is a machine that quickly and easily separates cotton fibers from their seeds and other objects. It is estimated that 1 lb. of unginned cotton contains 32-33% cotton fibers, 52-54% cotton seeds and around 15% foreign objects (stones, leaves, dirt etc.).
