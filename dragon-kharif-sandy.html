<h2>Soil for Dragon Fruit Cultivation</h2>
<p>You can grow this fruit in different types of soil, from sandy loam to clay loam. However, the ideal soil for its cultivation is sandy soils with good organic matter and a perfect drainage system. The pH of 5.5 to 7 is best for dragon fruit farming</p>
<h2>Dragon Fruit Agriculture Land Preparation</h2>
<p>You have to plough the field until the soil achieves its fine tilth and is weed-free. After that, you should apply any type of organic compost in a proportionate ratio. </p>
<h2>Dragon Fruit Plantation Method</h2>
<p>The most common dragon fruit propagation method is cuttings. However, you can also propagate it by seeds. But the seeds take a long time and will not continue their mother plant characteristics. Thatâ€™s why the seeds method is not suitable if you are the owner of a commercial dragon fruit farm. So, if you want complete advantages of dragon fruit farming, you should use the plant cuttings from the quality mother plant. You should use the 20 cm cuttings for planting in the field. Moreover, you have to pile up cuttings 2 days before the plantation.
Now you can plant them with a mixture of dry cow dung. You should keep the plant to plant distance of 2 meters x 2 meters. You have to dig 60 cm x 60 cm x 60 cm for the size of the pits. In addition, you have to fill these pits with topsoil and manure, including 100 grams of superphosphate. You can accommodate about 1700 plants in 1 acre of land.

<h2>Training of the Dragon Fruit Plant</h2>
<p>To get the huge dragon fruit farming profit or proper plant growth, you should give support of concrete or wooden columns. You have to tie Immature plants with these columns. To maintain the dragon shrub, you have to use a round/circular metal frame. </p>
<h2>Dragon Fruit Fertiliser and Manure</h2>
<p>For the good growth and development of the dragon fruit plant, organic manure plays a crucial role. You have to treat each plant with a minimum of 10 to 15 Kg of organic compost. After that, you have to increase the manure by 2 kg per year. Along with the organic, it also needs inorganic fertilisers to give good vegetative growth. The fertiliser ratio for vegetative stage is muriate of potash:superphosphate:urea = 40:90:70 grams /plant.
You also have to give a high amount of potash and a low amount of nitrogen at the fruit-bearing stage. Different types of fertilisers should be applied in the flowering to harvesting stages, including Urea:superphosphate:muriate of potash = 50:50:100 grams/plant. This solution can be given just before flowering, fruit developing, and after harvesting. It can increase the productivity of your dragon fruit farm.

<h2>Dragon Fruit Irrigation</h2>
<p>This plant requires less water in comparison to others. So, you can irrigate it frequently during the planting, flowering & fruit development stages and hot/dry climate conditions. For effective water usage, you can use111
<h2>Pests and Diseases</h2>
<p>This is the highest benefit in this farming in that it has no pests or diseases. So, you do not treat the plants with other chemicals. Therefore, it reduces the dragon fruit cultivation cost per acre.</p>
<h2>Dragon Fruit Harvesting</h2>
<p>Dragon fruit starts appearing on the plants in the first year. From Aug to Dec month, it bears the fruits, and fruits are ready for harvesting after one month of flowering. Apart from this, the flowering time continues till December. Picking up these fruits can be done up to 6 times within this period. When the fruits turn red, it is the best time for harvesting. The ideal time for harvesting is after 3 to 4 days of colour change. On the other hand, you should harvest them after 1 day of colour change for exporting. You can get 5 to 6 tonnes of production per acre. </p>
