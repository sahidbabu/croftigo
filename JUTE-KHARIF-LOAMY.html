    <h2>Land Preparation</h2>
    <p>Mesta being a rainfed crop, land preparation is usually done with the receipt of pre¬ monsoon showers. However, in Andhra Pradesh, for raising rabi mesta, the land preparation is done early in February for sowing the crop with the help of sub¬soil moisture. Land is to be ploughed with pre-monsoon shower followed by laddering to obtain fine tilth.</p>
    <h2>Sowing</h2>
    <p>The optimum plant population for mesta is a bout 4 to 5 lakh per hectare. The recommended row to row spacing is 25 to 30 cm and plant to plant spacing is 7 to 10 cm. if the crop is sown by broadcasting method then the plant to plant spacing is maintained at about 12¬ - 15 cm by thinning.

<br>Before sowing of seeds , it is always preferable to treat the seeds particularly to avoid the infection of the diseases to the crop . Seed treatment can be done with organomercural fungicide like Agrosan GN of Ceresan at the rate of 5 gm per kg of seed or Dithane M45 at the rate of 4 gm per kg of seed or Bavistin at the rate of 2 gm per kg of seed.
</p>
    <h2>Manures and Fertilizers</h2>
    <p>Fertilizer application: FYM @ 5 - 6 t/ha is to be applied during land preparation. In medium fertile soil, the recommended dose of fertilizer is 40:20:20 (N: P 2O 5 : K 2O, kg/ha). P and K will be applied as basal while N is to splitted as – 1/3 rd at sowing, 1/3 rd at time of first weeding (21 DAS) and 1/3 rd at second weeding (35 DAS). For drier tracts, if soil moisture is not favourable, foliar application of urea (1.0%) may be done.
In acid soils and regions with high rainfall, calcium and magnesium deficiency is common. Liming of soil @ 2¬5 t/ha, once in 4 y ears or Dolomite application (40 kg/ha) is found promising as it supplies both calcium and magnesium.<br>requirement of mesta is about 50 cm. if the rainfall is uniformly is highly uncertain, in that case it is desirable to give one or two irrigation to mesta crop at an interval of 15 to 20 days
</p>
    <h2>Water management</h2>
    <p>
In India, mesta is mainly raised as a rainfed crop . Since the pattern of rainfall during the sowing and growth period is highly erratic, desired yield is not obtained in mesta crop. For obtaining good yield, along with other inputs, the water requirement of the crop is to be fulfilled. The water </p>
    <h2>Plant Protection</h2>
    <p><h3>Pests </h3>   <br>
<strong>Jassids</strong><br>
Both adults and nymphs injure the plant by sucking plant sap and injecting toxin saliva into the leaf tissue. The edges of the affected leaves first turn pale green, later becomes yellowish green and finally red. In case of severe attack, the leaves curves downward and become crinkled. The plant growth becomes stunted and yield declines. <br>
<strong>Management :</strong><br>Early sowing prevents the attack of Jassid. Jassid tolerant varieties like AMV¬3 and AMV¬4 is to be grown. Light trap may be used to control this pest. Seed treatment with carbofuran 3G @ 30 g/kg of seed prevent the attack upto 30 days age. On the standing crop if there is attack of this pest, Methyl Demiton (Metasystox 25 EC) 0.05% @ one litre (in 500 litre of water) per hectare or Dimethoate 0.05% @ 800 ml (in 500 litre of water) per hectare may be applied. The pest may also be controlled by biological method. The spider predator viz., Chiracanthium mealnostoma or Thornisus katrajghatus or Oxyopes javanus may be conserved in the field and this will suppress the attack of Jassids.<br>
<strong>Spiral borer  </strong><br>
Spiral bores is found to attack mainly cannabinus mesta. It is most prevalent in high rainfall areas. The larva after hatching burrows its way beneath the cambium layer and starts feeding upon the woody tissues, making spiral around the stem beneath the bark and inner fibre layers are damaged. Infected regions swells up to form an elongated gall. Gall becomes week and breaks due to impact of strong wind.<br>
<strong>Management : </strong>Seeds should be treated with Malathion 5% or Sevin 5% @ 10 gm/kg of seed. Spraying Fenvalerate 2 0 per cent EC @1 ml/l it or Cypermethrin 25 per cent EC @ 1¬1.2 ml/lit, control the pest.
</p>
    <h2>Harvesting</h2>
    <p>The best time of harves ting is small pod stage for cannabinus mesta which usually occurs in October while for sabdariffa mesta it is at 50 per cent flowering which occurs in November. If the plants are harvested earlier to this, fibre yield will below and many of the fibre are immature and soft and may loss at the time of extraction if the harvesting is delayed or it is done at the maturity of the crop, the yield may be more but produces poor quality fibre which is brittle and less flexible as the cellulose reserves decline due to its utilization by developing fruits and seeds. The normal duration of harvesting of mesta is about 140 to 145 days</p>
