    <h2>Land and Bed Preparation for Sowing</h2>
    <p>To carry soil to a fine tilth, furrowing and digging activities are done. Getting the bed ready for development, 4 to 6 months prior to planting.<br>

While planning a bed for rose development, add 2 tons of all-around deteriorated cow fertilizer and 2 kg of Super Phosphate in soil. Then, at that point, do evening-out activity for uniform bed development. Developing rose on the bed is more productive than filling separately in pit.<br>
•	1-1.6 m wide,<br>
•	30-40 m long and<br>
•	15-20 cm/ 30-40 cm height<br>
•	5-0.75 m between two beds<br>
Sanitize media with steam at 70-100oC for 30 minutes or use methyl Bromide @ 25-30 g/M2/10 ml/cuft for 24-48 hr or Formalin @ 7.5-10.0 l/100 M2 or Utkarsh Silver H2O2 @ 2 liters/section of land or Basamid (Dazomet) @ 30-40 g/M2
</p>
    <h2>Spacing and Planting for Rose Farming</h2>
    <p>0.75 m from one pit to another and 0.75 m from one column to another in low thickness development accordingly obliging around 7,000 plants for every section of land with plant thickness 1.73 plants/m2.<br>
In the event of greenhouse culture, high thickness establishing will oblige around 28,000 plants for each section of land having plant thickness 7 plants/m2. Standard roses are planted at a dividing of 90-100 cm. Plantlets are planted following seven days of topping off the pits.<br>
<strong>Key Points to be taken care of while Planting:</strong><br>
•	6–18-month-old budded plants may be planted during May-June.<br>
•	Planting may be in a 2-row system.<br>
•	Per compartment of 6.40 metre, 6 rows of plants can be planned.<br>
•	The distance between the plants in one row varies around 15-20 cm.<br>
•	This results in 7 to 8 plants per meter square.<br>
•	Removing all the broken and bruised leaves while planting is important in rose farming.<br>

The best season to cultivate the Rose is between September to October. The rose plant needs managing/slicing every once in a while. It requires Organic matter which incorporates Farm Yard Manure (FMY) and a few composts at the hour of planting.
</p>
    <h2>Manuring and Fertilizers</h2>
    <p>The best opportunity to add natural compost is at the hour of pruning. FYM, leaf form, and oil cakes are great wellsprings of nitrogen. It is smarter to apply composts in a blend, for example, ‘roxe blend’. Rose Mix can be ready as:
Neem cake – 5 kg<br>
Bonemeal – 5 kg<br>
Ammophos – 2 kg<br>
Sulphate of Ammonia – 1 kg<br>
Superphosphate – 2 kg<br>
Sulphate of Potash – 1kg<br>

100 g of this blend can be utilized per plant. The chelated mixtures of iron, magnesium and manganese are accessible in the market which is useful in drawing out the full shade of blossoms.<br>
As a rule, each rose plant expects around 20-30 g urea, 30-50 g single superphosphate, 20-30 g sulfate of potash and oil cakes ½ kg to 1 kg in 2-3 split portions is suggested each year.<br>
</p>
    <h2>Irrigation and Water Management</h2>
    <p>Irrigation is done twice a week from October to March, Thrice a week from April to June. No water system is expected during the stormy season.
Water systems should not bring about waterlogging.<br>
3 a month in the wake of establishing a dribble water system might be utilized for uniform watering. Each plant has to be watered at one liter/plant/day.
A drip irrigation system is recommended; as each plant receives an equal amount of water. By providing the water straightforwardly on the preparing blend, the actual plant doesn’t become wet (so forestalling sicknesses).
</p>
    <h2>Time duration</h2>
    <p>The plants will start flowering in the first year and will give economic yield from the second year onwards. Flowering will commence from 45 days after pruning. Fully opened flowers are picked early in the morning. About 10 lakh flowers/ha/year can be obtained.</p>
    <h2>Harvesting</h2>
    <p>Harvesting is finished with a sharp item at the phase of tight bud when the shading is completely settled and the petals have not yet begun unfurling. Harvesting the blossom buds is done at the tight bud stage for a longer distance. At reap it regularly was practiced to scale back to the initial 5-leaf stage.
Subsequently, it is prescribed for scaling back to simply over the first cutting.
Yield starts 4-5 months after planting. Flower yield goes from 100-150 stems, 200-225, and 250-350 stems for every meter square in huge half breed tea, medium sorts, and little and splashes, individually.
