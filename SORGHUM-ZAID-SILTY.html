    <h1>SORGHUM</h1>
    <img src="SORGHUM1.jpg" alt="">
    <h2>SOIL</h2>
    <p> It grows on wide range of soil but sandy loam soil with good drainage is suitable for cultivation. pH of 6 to 7.5 is ideal for cultivation and better growth.</p>
    <h2>LAND PREPARATION</h2>
    <p>Give one deep ploughing every year in shallow to medium deep soil. Give one to two ploughing followed by 2 criss-cross harrowing. Prepare land in such a way that water stagnation will not occurrs in field.</p>
<h2>SOWING</h2>
<p><strong>Time of sowing</strong><br>
Optimum time for sowing is from Mid-June to Mid -July. For early green fodder, carryout sowing from middle of March.<br>

<strong>Spacing</strong><br>
For sowing use spacing of "45 cm x 15 cm" or "60 cm x10 cm".<br>

<strong>Sowing Depth</strong><br>
Seed should not be sown more than 2-3 cm depth.<br>

<strong>Method of sowing</strong><br>
In North India, sorghum is sown either by broadcast or sown in rows behind the plough.
</p>
<h2>SEED</h2>
<p><strong>Seed Rate</strong><br>
Use seed rate of 30-35 kg/acre for sowing.<br>

<strong>Seed Treatment</strong><br>
To protect crop soil borne disease, do seed treatment with 300 mesh sulphur powder@4gm and then Azotobacter@25gm/kg of seed before sowing.<br>

Use any one fungicides from below:
</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Fungicide name</th>
    <th>Quantity (Dosage per kg seed)</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Carbendazim</td>
    <td>2gm</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Captan</td>
    <td>2gm</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Thiram</td>
    <td>2gm</td>
  </tr>

<p>Before sowing add 4-6 tons of Farm Yard Manure or well decomposed cow dung in soil. Apply basal dose of N:P:K@20:8:10kg/acre in form of Urea@44kg, SSP@50kg/acre and Potash@16kg/acre. Apply all dose of P and K along with 50% N is applied as basal at the time of sowing. Apply remaining half dose of fertilizer, 30days after sowing.</p>
<h2>WEED CONTROL</h2>
<p>Spray with Atrazine (Atratop, Atrafil) @800 gm/acre (150 Ltr water) at 1-2 days after sowing with optimum moisture in soil. While spraying enough moisture should be present in soil.</p>
<h2>IRRIGATION</h2>
<p>To get good yield, give proper irrigation at important stages like tillering, flowering and grain formation stages. These are critical stages for irrigation. In kharif season it required one to three irrigation depending upon rainfall intensity. Under adequate water supply in rabi and summer season, irrigation should be given at all these critical stages. If water is available for 2 irrigation only, these should be applied at flower primordial initiation and flowering stages.</p>
<h2>PLANT PROTECTION</h2>
<p><strong>Pest and their control:</strong><br>
<strong>Sorghum shoot fly:</strong> They laid eggs on younger leaves. Eggs are of white, cylindrical shape while adults are of whitish grey color. Maggots are of yellowish color and grow inside stem leads to cut of stem. Shoot get dried and produces "dead heart". Side tillers are produces in affected plant. Plant come out easily when pulled out and gives bad smell. One to six week seedlings are more susceptible to this pest.<br>
<strong>Stem borer:</strong> Oval shape egg bunch observed undersurface of leaves near mid rib. Larvae are of yellowish brown with brown head. Moth is of straw colored. On infestation, withering and drying of central shoot is observed. Bore holes are observed on stem. Series of pin holes on emerging leaves.<br>
<strong>Ear head caterpillar: </strong>Eggs are creamy white and of spherical shape. Show color variation from greenish to brown having dark brown grey lines on body. Adults are of light pale brownish yellow moth. On incidence of this pest, earheads are partially eaten and gives chalky appearance. Excreta is observed within ear head.
</p>
<h2>HARVESTING</h2>
<p>The right time for harvest is when grains become hard and contain less than 25% moisture. Once crop gets mature, harvest it immediately. For harvesting sickles are used. The plants are cut from near the ground level. After then stalks are tied into bundles of convenient sizes and stacked on threshing floor. After two to three days removed ear heads from plants. In some cases only ear heads are removed from standing crop and collected at threshing floor. After then they are sun dry for 3-4 days.</p>
<h2>POST-HARVEST</h2>
<p>After proper drying carryout threshing operation with help of sticks or by trampling under bullock feet. Collect grain after threshing operation. Clean and dried them in sun for 6-7 days up-to 13-15% moisture content. Then stored them in clean and dry place.
