<h2>SOIL</h2>
<p>It can grow well in wide range of soil from sandy loam to clay. For late sown variety, clay loam soils are preferred and for early maturing varieties sandy loam soil is recommended. pH of soil should be in range of 6 to 7. Add lime in case of low pH soil.</p>
<h2>LAND PREPARATION</h2>
<p>Bring soil to fine tilth by ploughing land thoroughly. Add well decomposed cow dung and mixed well in soil at time of last ploughing.</p>
<h2>SOWING</h2>
<p><strong>Time of sowing</strong><br>
For early season variety June-July is best transplanting time, For main season variety August to mid-September and October to first week of November is best transplanting for late varieties.<br>

<strong>Spacing</strong><br>
Use spacing of 45x45 cm for main season crop whereas for early and late maturing crop use spacing of 45x30 cm.<br>

<strong>Sowing Depth</strong><br>
Sow seeds at depth of 1-2 cm.<br>

<strong>Method of sowing</strong><br>
For Sowing dibbling method and transplanting methods can be used.
Sow seeds in nursery and apply irrigation, fertilizer dose as per requirement. Seedlings are ready to transplant within 25-30 days after sowing. For transplantation use three to four weeks old seedlings.
</p>
<h2>SEED</h2>
<p><strong>Seeds Rate</strong><br>
For early season variety seed rate of 500 gm is required whereas for late and main season variety seed rate of 250 gm per acre is required.<br>

<strong>Seed Treatment</strong><br>
Before sowing dip seeds in hot water (50Â°C for 30 min) or streptocycline@0.01 gm/Ltr for two hours. After treatment dry them in shade and then sow on bed. Blackrot mostly observed in Rabi. As a preventive measure seed treatment with mercury chloride is essential. For that dip seeds in Mercury chloride@1 gm/Ltr solution for 30 min after that dry them in shed. Crop grown in sandy soils are more prone to stem rot. To prevent it do seed treatment with Carbendazim 50%WP@3 gm/kg of seeds.

<p>Apply well decomposed cow dung@40 tonnes per acre in soil along with Nitrogen@50 kg, Phophorus@25 kg and Potash@25 kg in form of Urea@110 kg, Single Superphosphate@155 kg and Muriate of Potash@40 kg. Apply whole quantity of cowdung, SSP and MOP and half quantity of Urea before transplanting. Apply remaining quantity of Urea four week after transplanting as top dressing.

To get better flower (Curd) set and to obtain good yield, spray Water Soluble Fertilizer (19:19:19)@5-7 gm/Ltr water during the early plant growth. 40 days after transplanting take spray of 12:61:00@4-5 gram + microneutrients@2.5 to 3 gram + Boron@1 gm per Ltr water. To improve curd quality, apply Water Soluble Fertilizer 13:00:45@8-10 gm/Ltr of water at the time of curd development.

Do soil testing and if Magnesium deficiency is observed to overcome Mg deficiency apply Magnesium sulphate@5 gm/Ltr, 30-35 days after transplantation and for Calcium deficiency apply Calcium Nitrate@5 gm/Ltr, 30-35 days after transplanting.

If Hollow and sometimes discolored stems are observed, Also curds become brown and leaves may get roll and curl it is due to Boron deficiency, apply Borax@250 gm-400 gm/acre.
</p>
<h2>WEED CONTROL</h2>
<p>To check weed control apply Fluchloralin (Basalin)800ml/150-200 Ltr water before transplantation followed by hand weeding 30 to 40 days after transplanting. Apply Pendimethalin@1 Ltr/acre one day before transplanting of seedlings.</p>
<h2>IRRIGATION</h2>
<p>Immediately after transplanting, give first irrigation. Depending upon soil, climatic condition, apply irrigation at interval of 7-8 days in summer season and 10-15 days during winter season.</p>
<h2>PLANT PROTECTION</h2>
<p><strong>Pest and their control:</strong><br>
<strong>Sucking pest: </strong>They suck the sap from the leaves resulting in yellowing and drooping of leaves. Thrips results in curling of leaves, leaves become cup shaped or curved upward.
If incidence of sucking pest like Aphid and Jassid is observed take spray of Imidacloprid 17.8SL@60ml/acre using 150 Ltr water. If infestation of Thrips is observed take Spray of Triazophos + Deltamethrin@20 ml or 25% Cypermethrin @5 ml/10 Ltr of water.<br>

<strong>Diamond back moth:</strong> Serious pest of cauliflower. They lay eggs under surface leaves. larva of greenish color with hair on body feed on leaves and make hole. In case of lack of proper control measures, it causes loss upto 80-90%.
At initial stage take spray of Neem Seed Kernel Extract@40 gm/Ltr of water at head initiation stage. Repeat this spray with interval of 10-15 days. Avoid spraying at curd formation. Take spray of Bt formulations@200 gm/acre at 35 and 50 days after planting. In severe infestation take spray of Spinosad 2.5%SC@80ml/150Ltr of water.<br>
<strong>Caterpillar: </strong>They feed on leaves and damage crop.
Spodoptera infestation mostly observed after rains. If per crop two caterpillars are observed then spray with B.T@10 gm/10 Ltr water in evening time. After that take neem ark@40 gm/Ltr spray. In case of high infestation take spray of Thiodicarb 75WP@40 gm/15 Ltr water. If infestation of leaf eating caterpillars is observed take spray of 60 ml Spinosad 2.5%EC or 100 gm Emamectin Benzoate 5SG/acre/150 Ltr water.<br>
<strong>Disease and their control:</strong><br>
<strong>Wilt:</strong> Dropping of entire leaves along with yellowing of crops. Wilting or drying of entire plant is seen. It may be due to root rot. To control wilt cause due to root rot, drench Trichoderma bio fungus@2.5 kg/500 Ltr water, near to roots of plants. Keeping checking crop losses due to fungal diseases. Drench root zone with Ridomil gold@2.5 gm/Ltr water. Give need based irrigation. Avoid flood irrigation.
Downy Mildew. Appearance of purplish-brown spots observed on lower side of leaves along with greyish white mold on leafs underside. Sanitation and crop rotation help in reducing infection. If infestation of downy is observed, it can be controlled by combined spraying of (Metalaxyl + Mancozeb)@2gm per litre. Take three sprays with 10 days interval.<br>
<strong>Leaf spot and Blight:</strong> If infestation of blight is observed to control take spray of Mancozeb or Copper oxychloride @300gm/150 Ltr along with 20 ml sticker.<br>
<strong>Alternaria leaf spot:</strong> Remove and burn lower leaves in morning subsequent take spray of tebuconazole 50%+ Trifloxystrobin 25%@120 gm/acre or Mancozeb@2gm/lit or Carbendazim@1gm/lit of water.
</p>
<h2>HARVESTING</h2>
<p> After developing proper head harvesting can be done. Carry out harvesting in morning or evening time. After harvesting keep product in cool place.</p>
<h2>POST-HARVEST</h2>
<p> After harvesting, do sorting and grading depending upon curd size.</p>
