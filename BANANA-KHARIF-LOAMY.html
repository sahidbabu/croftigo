    <h1>BANANA</h1>
    <img src="BANANA1.jpg" alt="BANANA1">
    <h2>Preparation of land:</h2>
    <p>•	Plough the land thoroughly atleast for 3-4 times and add about 10 tonnes of well rotten FYM or Compost during last plough and mix it well or add 10-15 kg FYM/ Compost per pit of 60x60x60 cm dimension.</p>
    <h2>Selection of Suckers:</h2>
    <p>•	Select ‘Sword Suckers’ with broad corm with narrow sword like leaves, from viral, fungal and bacterial disease free mother plants.<br>
•	The suckers should be 3-5 months old, uniform in size, weighing 1-1.5 kg.
</p>
    <h2>Sucker Treatment and planting</h2>
    <p>•	The selected suckers should be ‘pared’ by trimming of all the roots along with surface layers superficially to remove any rotten portion of the corm. <br>
•	Keep the treated suckers in shade overnight before planting. Plant the suckers in the center of the pit and press the soil around the suckers firmly.
</p>
    <h2>Calendar of Operations</h2>
<h3>During First month</h3>
    <p>•	Wherever necessary, ‘Gap Filling’ should be done to replace the un- sprouted as well as rotten suckers. Seeds of green manure </p>
<h3>Second Month</h3>
<p>•	Application of Azospirillum and phosphobacteria @ 30 g and Trichoderma viride @ 30g along with 5-10 kg FYM plant-1.<br>
•	There should a gap of minimum 2-3 weeks between the application of chemical fertilizers and biofertilizers.
</p>
<h3>Third Month</h3>
<p>•	Application of 40g of Carbofuron to control nematodes.<br>
•	Digging and weeding.<br>
•	Application of first dose of fertilizers @ 100:300:100 g Urea, Super Phosphate and MOP per plant in basins made about 30 cm away from the plant.
</p>
<h3>Fourth Month</h3>
<p>•	Application of Azospirillum and phosphobacteria @ 30 g and Trichoderma viride @ 30g along with 5-10 kg FYM plant-1.<br>
•	There should a gap of minimum 2-3 weeks between the application of chemical fertilizers and biofertilizers.
</p>
<h3>Fifth Month</h3>
<p>•	Application of second dose of fertilizers @ 150:150 g Urea and MOP+ 300g neemcake per plant in the basins made about 45 cm away from the plant.<br>
•	Removal of dried leaves.<br>
•	Digging and weeding.<br>
•	To prevent the egg laying and further attack of stem weevil, spray ‘Neemosol’ @12.5ml/litre or Chlorpyriphos @ 2.5ml/litre on the stem.<br>
•	To monitor the corm and stem weevil, 2 ft long longitudinal stem trap @40 traps/acre can be placed at different places. The collected weevils are to be killed using kerosene.
</p>
<h3>Sixth Month</h3>
<p>•	To correct the deficiency of zinc, spray 0.5% zinc sulphate solution along with wetting agent.<br>
•	Foliar application of 0.5 Borax is recommended to correct the deficiency.<br>
•	For controlling the stem weevil attack, using ‘Banana Injector’, inject 2ml of Monocrotophos (150 ml Monocrotophos mixed in 350 ml of water) at 2 and 4 feet height on opposite direction.
</p>
<h3>Seventh Month</h3>
<p>•	Application of third dose of fertilizers @ 150:150 g Urea and MOP per plant in the basins made about 60 cm away from the plant.<br>
•	Injection of 2ml of Monocrotophos using ‘Banana Injector’ at 2 and 4 feet height for the control of stem weevil.
</p>
<h3>Eighth Month</h3>
<p>•	After flowering, only one healthy side sucker should be allowed for first ratoon and the remaining suckers should be killed using kerosene or uprooted.<br>
•	After the emergence of the last hand, the male bud has to be removed leaving about 15 cm stalk from the last hand.
</p>
<h3>Ninth Month</h3>
<p>•	Thirty days after the first spray, give a second spray of 2% Potassium Sulphate (20g/litre of water) solution with surfactant by thoroughly drenching the bunch.<br>
•	Provide casuarina pole or bamboo support to the plants for tall and heavy bearing bunches.
</p>
    <h2>Irrigation</h2>
    <p>Banana, a water loving plant, requires a large quantity of water for maximum productivity. But Banana roots are poor withdrawal of water. Therefore under Indian condition banana production should be supported by an efficient irrigation system like drip irrigation.
Water requirement of banana has been worked out to be 2000mm per Annum. Application of drip irrigation and mulching technology has reported improved water use efficiency. There is saving of 56% of water and increasing yield by 23-32% under drip.
Irrigate the plants immediately after planting. Apply sufficient water and maintain field capacity. Excess irrigation will lead to root zone congestion due to removal of air from soil pores, thereby affecting plant establishment and growth. And hence drip method is must for proper water management in Banana
</p>
    <h2>Harvesting</h2>
    <p>Banana should be harvested at the physiological maturity stage for better post harvest quality. The fruit is climacteric and can reach consumption stage after ripening operation</p>
