  <h2>1.Sowing – </h2>
  <p>o	We start by purchasing the potato seed. It is necessary to purchase only certified disease-free seed potatoes from legitimate sellers. About 2 days before planting, we open the bag and we inspect the tubers. Rotten or wet tubers must be removed immediately. Most potato seed tubers have a diameter of 45-60 mm. These tubers may need to be cut into smaller pieces (often called “sets”). Tubers that have a diameter of 28-35 mm normally do not require cutting and can be planted whole.<br>
o	 We first dig a trench (or channel) of 4-6 inches (10-15cm) depth.The next trench must be spaced at least 28 inches (70cm) from the first one. We put the potato sets (pieces) inside the trench at a distance of at least 10 inches (25cm) apart. We then flatten our field by covering the trenches with soil. At that point, we must “earth up” our crops by creating hills.We must hill them by mounding soil from each side of the row about 4 inches (10cm) high along the base of the plants.
</p>
<h2>2.Manuring and Fertilizing </h2>
<p>o	Most farmers apply a Nitrogen- Phosphorus- Potassium 15-15-15 at the same time with planting.The potassium in N-P-K 15-15-15 stimulates growth of strong stems and provides some disease and pest tolerance by increasing the thickness of the outer cell walls. <br>
o	As a rule of thumb, potato plants have greater needs in Nitrogen (N-P-K 34-0-0) during the first two months. From the second month until two weeks before harvest, the plants need more potassium (12-12-17 or 14-7-21) in order to create well shaped potatoes. To these, many farmers often add foliar fertilizer during the second or third month, especially when their potato plants have been diagnosed with micronutrient deficiencies.
</p>
<h2>3.Irrigation </h2>
<p>o	The irrigation systems most commonly used in potato cultivation are drip irrigation (labor intensive), sprinkler systems, overhead rain guns and boom irrigation. <br>
o	The crop water requirements (ETm) for a 120 to 150 day crop are 500 to 700 mm, depending on climate. The water needs of potato plants are generally smaller during the first stages of the plant development and they gradually increase during maturation and the later stages of tuber growth
</p>
<h2>4.Plant Protection </h2>
<p>Colorado Potato Beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata) is major problem. The beetles eat the foliage and slowly skeletonize the crop. Adult beetles emerge in spring. Bacillus thuringiensis is effective at fighting larvae but it must be applied several times.</p>
<h2>5.Harvesting and storing </h2>
<p>o	A widely used pre harvesting technique is called “killing”. Many farmers “kill” the potato plants by stopping all irrigation, by mechanical means and/or by spraying chemicals and thus literally killing the upper part of the plants. After killing the plants, they let the potatoes in the ground for another 10-14 days before harvesting. In this way, the skin of potatoes becomes thick, something that is preferred by certain markets for various reasons (the potatoes can be transported with a lower risk of bruising etc.). <br>
o	2,5 to 4 months after planting, the potatoes are ready to be harvested. Potatoes are harvested through modern potato harvesting machines that are attached to tractors. The machines harvest by lifting the potatoes from the bed using a share. Soil, dirt, rocks and potatoes are transferred onto a series of webs where the potatoes are finally separated from the foreign materials. <br>
o	After harvested, potatoes are stored in a cool but not freezing (40°F/4.4°C) dark, humid place. Potatoes can generally be stored for several months in proper conditions. Commercial potato growers store their potatoes in huge buildings built especially for storing potatoes. Specialized air circulation systems keep the temperature and humidity as uniform as possible in the pile.
