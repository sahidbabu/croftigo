    <h2>LAND PREPARATION:</h2>
    <p>Plough land thoroughly and make land weed and clods free. Add well decomposed cow dung of 5-10ton/acre and mix well in soils at time of land preparation. Avoid use of undecomposed or free cow dung as it will leads to forking of fleshy roots</p>
<h2>SOWING</h2>
<p>Time of sowing <br>
<strong>PusaHimani:</strong> Optimum time for sowing is January-February. <br>
<strong>Punjab Pasand:</strong> Optimum time for sowing is from second fortnight of March where as for Pusachetki optimum time for sowing is from April-August. <br>
<strong>Japanese white: </strong>Optimum time for sowing is from November-December.<br>
<strong>Spacing: </strong><br>
Use row to row spacing of 45 cm and plant to plant spacing of 7.5cm. <br>
<strong>Sowing Depth:</strong> <br>
For good growth, sow seeds at depth of 1.5cm <br>
<strong>Method of Sowing:</strong><br>
Sowing can be done by Line Sowing and Broadcasting method. <br>
</p>
<h2>SEED</h2>
<p><strong>Seed Rate:</strong> For sowing of one acre land seed rate of 4-5kg is sufficient. It is sown on ridge for proper root development.</p>
<h2>FERTILIZER</h2>

<p>Along with well decomposed cowdung, apply Nitrogen@25kg (in form of Urea@55kg), Phosphorus@12kg (in form of SSP@ 75kg/acre) per acre in soil at time of sowing.</p>
<h2>WEED CONTROL</h2>
<p>Take interculture operation like weeding and hoeing to keep check on weed growth also to provide soil aeration. Take one weeding operation, two to three weeks after sowing. After weeding, carryout earthing operation</p>
<h2>IRRIGATION</h2>
<p>After sowing, apply first irrigation, it will help in good germination. Depending upon soil type and climate, apply remaining irrigations at interval of 6-7days in summer and 10-12 days interval in winter month. Overall radish required five to six irrigations. Avoid excessive irrigation as it will leads misshape of roots and numerous hair growth. In summer season, provide pre-harvest light irrigation. It will keep root fresh and reduce pungency.</p>
<h2>PLANT PROTECTION</h2>
<p>•<strong>	Pest and their control:</strong><br>
<strong>Aphid:</strong>Serious pest of Radish, attacked at seedling as well as at maturity stage. If infestation is observed, spraying of Malathion 50EC@1ml/Litre of water should be done. Repeat spray for two-three times at interval of 10days.<br>
•	<strong>Disease and their control:</strong><br>
<strong>Alternaria blight:</strong> Slightly raised, yellow spots are observed on leaves. Infection is rapidly spread in rainy season. Fungus spread on pods and seeds loose viability.<br>
If infestation is observed, spraying of Mancozeb@2gm/lit of water or Carbendazim@1gm/lit of water should be done to control this disease.<br>
<strong>Flea beetles and mustard saw fly:</strong> If infestation is observed in field, to control take spray of Malathion 50EC@1ml/Litre of water. Repeat spray for two-three times at interval of 10days.<br>
</p>
<h2>HARVESTING</h2>
<p>Depending upon variety, radish is ready for harvesting in 25-60days after sowing. Harvesting is done manually by uprooting plants. Harvested roots are washed and then graded upon size</p>
<h2>POST-HARVEST</h2>
<p>After harvesting grading of radish depending upon size is carried out. The product is marketed loose to sometime they are packed in gunny bags or basket.</p>
