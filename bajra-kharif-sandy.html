<h2>The agro-climatic requirement for Bajra cultivation:</h2>
<p>Bajra grows well in dry and warm climatic conditions and it's drought-tolerant crop which requires low annual rainfall ranging between 40 cm to 60 cm. The ideal temperature for Bajra cultivation is between 20 °C to 30 °C. Moist weather is advantageous during its vegetative growth. In North India, Bajra is grown as Kharif crop and in some southern parts is grown as summer crop providing Irrigation.</p>
<h2>Soil requirement for Bajra crop plantation:</h2>
<p>Bajra can be grown in a wide range of soils. However, It thrives best in black cotton soils, sandy loam soils having good drainage. This crop does not prefer acidic and waterlogging soils. Avoid saturated soils for its cultivation. It grows successfully well in soils with low pH (or) high salinity. Bajra can be easily grown in regions where other cereal crops like wheat or maize would not survive.</p>
<h2>The field preparation for Bajra sowing:</h2>
<p>2 to 3 harrowing followed by a plowing is required to make the soil in the field to the fine tilth. Any weeds should be destroyed during the field preparation to accommodate proper sowing and distribution of seed at an appropriate depth.</p>
<h2>The seed treatment of Bajra:</h2>
<p>The organic mercurial compound Ceresan, Agrosan should be used @ 2-3 kg per hectare to control seed-borne diseases.</p>
<h2>Seed rate and Spacing in Bajra plants:</h2>
<p>The seed rate and spacing in Bajra plants is as follows:<br>
•	3 to 3.5 kg/ha for dibbling method.<br>

•	5 to 5 kg/ha for the drilling method.<br>
Row spacing of 40 cm to 45 cm should be maintained and within rows, 10 cm-15 cm should be kept.
</p>
<h2>Manures and Fertilizer requirement of Bajra crop:</h2>
<p>Even Bajra requires fewer nutrients If you are cultivating commercial hybrid Bajra, adding Farm Yard Manure (F.M.Y) or Compost result in better yield and quality of seed. Apply these organic manures at the time of soil or land preparation so that soil will become fully decomposed by the time of sowing. 90-100 kg of N: 50-60 kg of P: 50-60 kg of K is recommended for hybrid variety.

Fertilizers should be applied in split doses. At the time of sowing, full phosphorus and potash and half of the nitrogen should be added as basal application. 1/4th nitrogen should be added after 30 and 60 days (after sowing).
</p>
<h2>Pests, diseases, and control of Bajra:</h2>
<p>Grasshoppers and stem bores are major pests in Bajra cultivation. These can be controlled by dusting the crop with BHC 5 % (or) 2 sprayings with 2 liters of Eldrin 20 c.c. The main disease in Bajra farming is "Downy mildew, to control this disease, treat the seeds with a fungicide like M-45 @ 2.0kg/ha (or) Dithane Z-78 in 900-1000 liters of water.</p>
<h2>Harvesting Procedure and threshing of Bajra crop:</h2>
<p>The crop is ready for harvesting when the grain become hardy & contain moisture. Two methods can be followed in harvesting Bajra crop: Cutting earhead or cutting of entire plants by sticks. stalk the cut plants for 4 to 5 days in the sun for drying grains. Grains can be separated by beating the earheads.</p>
<h2>The Yield of Bajra:</h2>
<p>Rainfed crop yields about 12 to 16 quintals/ha and irrigated crop yields about 25 to 35 quintals/ha. The yield also depends on the soil type, variety, season, and cultivation practices.</p>
