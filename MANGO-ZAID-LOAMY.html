    <h1>MANGO</h1>

    <h2>Planting Material

</h2>
    <p>Mango can be propagated from seed or propagated vegetatively. Plants are generally propagated vegetatively by using several techniques like veneer grafting, inarching and epicotyl grafting etc.</p>
    <h2>Spacing</h2>
    <p>The planting distance is 10m. x 10m. and 12m. x 12m. in dry and moist zones respectively.  In the model scheme, a spacing of 8m. x 8m. with a population of 63 plants per acre has been considered which was observed to be common in areas covered during a field study.</p>
    <h2>Nutrition</h2>
    <p>Fertilizers may be applied in two split doses , one half immediately after the harvesting of fruits in June/July and the other half in October, in both young and old orchards followed by irrigation if there are no rains. Foliar application of 3 % urea in sandy soils is recommended before flowering.</p>
<p>
The following table gives the details of fertilizer applied (depending upon the age of the plants) :
</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Age of the plant(IN YEARS)</th>
    <th>Fertilizer applied</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1*</td>
    <td>100g. N, 50g. P2O5, 100g. K2O</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>10</td>
    <td>1kg. N, 500g. P2O5, 1kg. K2O</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>11</td>
    <td>-</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>*The doses applied in the subsequent years should be increased every year upto
10 years in the multiple of the first year’s dose.
Well decomposed farm-yard manure may be applied every year. For trench application of fertilizers, 400g. each of N and K2O and 200g. of P2O5 per plant should be provided. Micro-nutrients may be applied as per the requirement in the form of foliar sprays.
</p>
    <h2>Irrigation</h2>

    <p>The frequency and amount of irrigation to be provided depends on the type of soil, prevailing climatic conditions, rainfall and its distribution and lastly the age of the trees. No irrigation is required during the monsoon months unless there are long spells of drought.</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Age of the plant (in years)/Growth stage</th>
    <th>Irrigation schedule</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td> Irrigated at an interval of 2-3 days during dry season.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2-5</td>
    <td> Irrigation interval- 4-5 days .</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>5-8/ fruit set to maturity</td>
    <td>Irrigated after every 10-15 days</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Full bearing stage</td>
    <td>2-3 irrigations after fruit set.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Frequent irrigation during 2-3 months prior to the flowering season is not advisable as it is likely to promote vegetative growth at the expense of flowering. Irrigation should be given at 50% field capacity. Generally inter-crops are grown during the early years of plantation and hence frequency and method of irrigation has to be adjusted accordingly. The method usually followed for irrigating mango plants is basin irrigation. However, use of Drip Irrigation will not only reduce the water requirements but will also help in fertigation in root zones of the plants.</p>

    <h2>Plant Protection Measures</h2>
    <h4>Insect Pests</h4>
    <p>Insect pests mostly observed are mealy bug, hopper, inflorescence midge, fruit fly and scale insects.  For controlling these insects, spraying with carbaryl, monocrotophos, phosphamidon & methyl parathion are recommended.</p>
<h2>FERTILIZER WE HAVE TO USE:</h2>
    <p>In general, 170 gm urea, 110 gm single super phosphate and 115 gm muriate of potash per plant per Page 4 year of the age from first to tenth year and thereafter 1.7 kg, 1.1 kg, and 1.15 kg respectively of these fertilisers per plant per year can be applied in two equal split doses </p>
<h2>
Diseases and Disorders

</h2>
<p>The crop is suspect to diseases like powdery mildew, anthracnose, die back, blight, red rust, sooty mould, etc.  In order to control these diseases spraying of appropriate chemicals/fungicides have to be undertaken preferably on preventive basis.

Disorders can also affect the crop if proper case and control measures are not taken.  The major among these are malformation, biennial bearing, fruit drop, black tip, clustering etc.  The grower needs to seek advice and professional assistance to prevent/control diseases and disorders in the crop.

</p>
<h2>Harvesting  and Yield</h2>
<p>The orchard starts bearing from sixth year onwards and the economic life of a mango tree exceeds 35 years.

Yield of fruits varies considerably according to the variety, climatic conditions, plant population etc.  On an average, the yield ranges from 5 to 9 t/acre.  Grafted plants start bearing early.
</p>
<h2>POST HARVEST MANAGEMENT</h2>

<p><h3>Grading</h3>

Grading is mainly based on the size, colour and maturity of the fruits. While grading, smaller fruits are separated from the larger ones in order to achieve uniform ripening. Immature, overripe, damaged and diseased fruits are discarded in the process of grading.

The fruits are generally harvested early in the season at a pre-mature stage to capture early market. Such fruits are ripened by uniformly dipping in 750 ppm. ethrel (1.8ml./l.) in hot water at 52±20 C for 5 minutes. within 4-8 days under ambient conditions. Mature fruits are ripened with lower doses of ethrel for uniform colour development.

<h3>Storage</h3>

The mature green fruits can be stored at room temperature for about 4-10 days depending upon the variety. The harvested fruits are pre-cooled to 10-120 C and then stored at an appropriate temperature
<h3>Packing</h3>

Wooden or cardboard boxes, rectangular in shape and bamboo baskets having capacity to accommodate 5 to 8kg. of fruit is used for packaging and transportation of mango fruits. The most commonly used containers are ventilated card board boxes of corrugated fibre board (CFB) cartons. Size of the box varies to accommodate 5 to 10 kg. of fruit.
