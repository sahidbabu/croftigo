    <h2>Transplanting of seedlings:</h2>
    <p>1. At the time of transplanting, they should be stocky and bear 3-5 true leaves.<br>
2. After transplanting, a light irrigation or watering with rose cane should be done.<br>
3. In general, spacing should be 30 cm x 30 cm for French marigold and 40 cm x 40 cm for African   marigold.
</p>
    <h2>Manure and fertilizers</h2>
    <p>1. Well decomposed FYM @ 24 t/ha should be mixed before ploughing.<br>
2. In addition recommended N:P:K fertilizer dose would be 100:75:75.<br>
3. Half quantity of nitrogen should be and full of potash and phosphorus should be applied as basal dose, preferably one week after transplanting.<br>
4. The remaining quantity of nitrogen should be 30-40 days after transplanting.<br>
5. Marigold also requires zinc and boron for flower quality and yield.
</p>
    <h2>Weeding</h2>
    <p>1.	Weeds are a major problem in marigold especially in rainy season crop. If the weeds are not removed in time, a great loss would occur in terms of growth and productivity of marigold.<br>
2.	During the entire growth 3-4 manual weeding are required<br>
3.	Weeding should be done as and when necessary.
</p>
    <h2>Irrigation</h2>
    <p>1. Irrigation is done once in a week or as and when necessary.<br>
2. Irrigate the crop in 7-8 days interval, but the frequency and quantity of water also depend upon soil and season. In lighter soil, more frequent irrigation is required than that in heavy soil.<br>
3. In hot summer it requires irrigation after 405 days interval while at 10-12 days interval in winter months.<br>

4. Constant moisture supply be maintained from bud formation to harvesting of flowers.

    <h2>Harvesting of Flowers:</h2>
    <p>1. After transplanting plans take 40-50 days to flower.<br>
2. Loose flowers are plucked when attain full size depending upon the variety.<br>
3. Flowers should be harvested in the morning hours.<br>
4. Irrigation before plucking gives better flower quality.<br>
5. For Garland stalk less fully opened flowers (loose flowers) are picked, white for vase decoration also fully opened flowers with stalk are plucked. to market.<br>
6. From one plant near about 100 to 150 flowers are obtained. Blooming duration is near about 3 months.
</p>
<h2>Packing:</h2>
<p>1. After harvesting, it is better to keep flowers in cool place.<br>

2. The marigold is packed in gunny bags for local market and for distance market bamboo basket are used.
</p>
<h2>Yield:</h2>
<p>African marigolds yield about 15-28 t/ha whereas the French marigold yields 10-12 t/ha.</p>
