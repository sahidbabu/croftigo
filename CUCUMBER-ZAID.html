    <h1>CUCUMBER</h1>

    <h2>SOIL</h2>
    <p>It can be sown in variety of soils ranging from sandy loam to heavy soil. But a loamy soil which is rich in organic matter and has well drainage system is best for the cucumber farming. The pH ranging from 6-7 is suited best for cucumber farming.</p>
<h2>LAND PREPARATION</h2>
<p>For cucumber plantation, it requires well prepared and weed free field. To bring soil to fine tilth, 3-4 ploughings must be done before planting. FYM such as cow dung is mixed with soil to enrich the field. Then nursery beds are prepared having width of 2.5m and at the distance of 60cm.</p>
<h2>SOWING</h2>
<p><strong>Time of sowing:</strong> <br>
It is sown in the month of February-March. <br>

<strong>Spacing:</strong>
Sow two seeds per place of bed which is 2.5m wide and use spacing of 60cm between seeds.<br>

<strong>Sowing depth:</strong> <br>
Seeds are sown at the depth of 2-3cm. <br>

<strong>Method of sowing:</strong>
•	Low tunnel technology: This technology is used to produce early yield of cucumber in early summer. It helps to protect the crop from cold season i.e. in the month of December and January. Beds of 2.5m width are sown in the month of December. Seeds are sown both sides of the bed at the distance of 45cm. Before sowing supportive rods of 45-60cm length are fixed in the soil. Cover the field with plastic sheet (100 gauge thickness) with the help of support rods. Plastic sheet should be removed mainly in the month of February when temperature is suitable outside. <br>
•	Dibbling method <br>
•	Basing method <br>
•	Layout in ring method
</p>
<h2>SEED</h2>
<p><strong>Seed rate:</strong>
Seed rate of 1.0 kg is sufficient for one acre of land.

<strong>Seed treatment:</strong>
Before sowing seeds, treat them with the suitable chemical to protect them from disease and pests and to increase viability. Seeds are treated with Captan@2gm before sowing.
</p>
<h2>FERTILIZER</h2>
<h3>Fertilizer Requirement (kg/acre):</h3>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>UREA</th>
    <th>SSP</th>
    <th>MOP</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>90</td>
    <td>125</td>
    <th>35</th>
  </tr>
</table>
<h3>Nutrient Value (kg/acre):</h3>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>NITROGEN</th>
    <th>PHOSPHORUS</th>
    <th>POTASH</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>40</td>
    <td>20</td>
    <td>20</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>At the time of land preparation apply fertilizer dose of Nitrogen @40kg (Urea@90kg), phosphorus @20kg (Single phosphate @125kg) and potassium@20kg (Muriate of potash@35kg) as a basal dose. At the time of sowing, apply one third of the Nitrogen dose along with Potassium and Single superphosphate. At the early stage of veins production i.e. one month of sowing apply rest of the dose.</p>
<h2>WEED CONTROL</h2>
<p>Weed can be controlled by hand-hoeing and also controlled by chemically, use glyphosate@1.6litre per 150 litre of water. Use glyphosate only on weeds not on crop plants.</p><br>
<h2>IRRIGATION</h2>
<p>In summer season it requires frequent irrigation and in rainy season it does not require any irrigation. In total it requires 10-12 irrigations. Pre-irrigation is required before sowing then subsequent irrigation is required after 2-3 days of sowing. After second sowing, the crops are then irrigated at the interval of 4-5 days. Drip irrigation is very useful for this crop.</p>
<h2>PLANT PROTECTION</h2>
<p><strong>Disease and their control:</strong><br>
<strong>Anthracnose:</strong> It attacks almost all parts of the cucumber which are above the ground. The symptoms are yellowish color circular spots are seen on the older leaves and the circular and sunken spots are seen on the fruit.<br>
<strong>Treatment:</strong> Fungicidal application of Chlorothalonil and benomyl is given to protect the crop from disease.<br>
<strong>Bacterial wilt: </strong>It is caused by Erwinia tracheiphila. It affects the vascular tissues of the plant which result in immediate wilting.<br>
<strong>Treatment:</strong> Spraying of foliar insecticides is done to cure the bacterial wilt.<br>
<strong>Pest and their control:</strong><br>
<strong>Fruit fly:</strong> It is serious pest found in cucumber. Females fly lay eggs below epidermis of young fruits. Later on maggots feed on pulp afterward fruits starts rotting and get drop.<br>
<strong>Treatment:</strong> Foliar application of Neem oil @3.0%is given to cure the crop from fruit fly pest.<br>
</p>
<h2>HARVESTING</h2>
<p>Plants start yielding in about 45-50 days after sowing. Mainly 10-12 harvestings can be done. Harvesting is mainly done when the seed of cucumber are soft and the fruits are green and young. Harvesting is done with the help of sharp knife or any sharp object. It gives an average of 33-42qtl/acre of yield.</p>
<h2>SEED PRODUCTION</h2>
<p>Brown color fruits are best for seed production. For seed extraction, fruit pulp is taken out in fresh water for 1-2 days for the easy separation of seeds. The seeds are then rubbed with hands and as a result heavy seeds will settle down in water and then they are preserved for further use.</p>
