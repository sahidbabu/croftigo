<h2>Steps of Cultivation:</h2>
<h3>1.Sowing Method– </h3>
<p>o	Onions can be grown from seeds, seedlings and bulblets.<br>
o	 About 0.05hectare nursery bed area is enough for getting seedlings to transplant in one hectare.<br>
o	The field should be ploughed 5-6 times to break clods and well pulverized to hold water <br>
o	  About 5-7 kg seeds are required to raise seedlings for one hectare.Seeds should be sown in lines at 50 mm to 75 mm apart to facilitate the removal of seedlings for transplanting, quick weeding, spray of pesticides.<br>
o	Seedlings are available for transplanting in 35-40 days after sowing. <br>
o	 The onion seedling should be transplanted into BBFs. The optimum spacing is 15 cm between the rows and 10 cm between plants.<br>
</p>
<h3>2.Manuring and Fertilizing–</h3>
<p>o	Organic manures equivalent to 75 kg N <br>
o	(FYM – Approx. 15 t/ha or <br>
o	Poultry manure- Approx. 7.5 t/ha or <br>
o	Vermicompost – Approx. 7.5 t/ha) <br>
o	One third of recommended N and full dose of P2O5 and K2O are applied at the time of planting while remaining two third N is applied in two equal splits at 30 and 45 days after planting. <br>
o	In addition to NPK, sulphur is also an essential plant nutrient important for onion crop for improving yield and the pungency of onion bulbs. <br>
o	Sulphur is recommended as basal dose at the time of transplanting. Application of 15 kg sulphur/ha is sufficient for growing onion crops in soils having sulphur level above 25 kg/ha while 30 kg sulphur/ha is needed for soils having sulphur level below 25 kg/ha for optimum production of onion. Soil application of 50 kg S /ha is recommended for long day onion crops. <br>
</p>
<h3>3.Irrigation – </h3>
<p>o	Onion needs irrigation at the time of transplanting, three days after transplanting and subsequently at   7-10 days interval depending upon the soil moisture. In general, Kharif crop needs 5-8 irrigations, the late Kharif crop requires 10-12 and Rabi crop needs 12-15 irrigations. Onion being a shallow rooted crop, needs frequent light irrigation to maintain optimum soil moisture for proper growth and bulb development.
o	Modern irrigation techniques such as drip and micro sprinkler irrigation help in saving irrigation water and improve the marketable bulb yield significantly. In case of drip irrigation, seedlings need to be planted at a spacing of 10 x 15 cm in a broad bed furrow (BBF) of 15 cm height and 120 cm top width with 45 cm furrow. Each BBF should have two drip laterals at (16 mm size) 60 cm distance with inbuilt emitters. The distance between two inbuilt emitters should be around 30-50 cm and the discharge flow rate is 4 l/hr. In case of micro sprinkler, the distance between two laterals (20 mm) of micro sprinkler should be 6m with a discharge rate of 135 l/hr. The research outcome indicated that the drip irrigation at 100 % Pan Evaporation (PE) significantly improved the marketable bulb yield (15-25%) with higher per cent A grade bulbs, water saving of about 35-40% and labour saving of 25-30% as compared to flood irrigation.
</p>
<h3>4.Plant Protection–</h3>
<p>Control of weeds at the initial growth stages is essential for getting high marketable bulb yield. Because of labour scarcity, chemical control of weeds along with cultural methods is inevitable. Application of Oxyflurofen @ 23.5% EC (1.5 -2.0 ml/L)/ Pendimethalin @ 30% EC (3.5-4ml/L) before transplanting or at the time of transplanting followed by one hand weeding at 40-60 days after transplanting is recommended for efficient weed control.</p>
<h3>5.Harvesting–</h3>
<p>o	Onion is harvested depending upon the purpose for which the crop is planted. 0nion crop is ready for harvesting in five months for dry onion. However, for marketing as green onion, the crop becomes ready in three months after transplanting.  <br>
o	Since onion bulbs are normally formed at the soil surface, it is sometimes possible in sandy soils to pull the mature bulbs by hand. Where conditions make hand pulling impossible, crop is harvested by loosening the bulbs with a fork or hoe before lifting them. The harvested crop is left in windrows in the field for a few days until the tops are dry. The windrows should be made so that the green tops cover the bulbs to protect them from sunburn. The leaves are cut leaving about 2-2.5 cm tops above the bulb after complete drying. This practice helps to increase the dry matter content. If tops are cut too close, the neck does not close well and provides entry for decay organisms. <br>
                                      Yield <br>
o	Irrigated onion crop in rabi season gives an yield of 25-30 t/ha while under rainfed conditions it yields only about 0.7-1.0 t/ha. Onion raised as an intercrop in sugarcane and turmeric, in alleys of young fruit garden and banana garden, gives a yield of 5-9 t/ha. The small sized, pungent, local cluster type onion yields half as compared to the large sized varieties.
</p>
<h3>6.Storage–</h3>
<p>o	Onions are stored in a well-ventilated place with lot of aeration and sunlight. Onion bulbs are packed in perforated gunny bags and stalked in vertical column, one above the other. However, height of such vertical column should not exceed more than 5 feet and should have sufficient space all around and bottom.
