    <h1>CASSAVA</h1>

    <h2>Climate</h2>
    <p>1.	Cassava is typically grown in tropical lowlands and requires at least 8 months of warm weather to mature. It likes full sun and requires temperatures ranging from 77 to 81 degrees Fahrenheit and at least 19.6 inches of rain annually. Cassava will not tolerate frost, so it grows best in a greenhouse or with cold frame protection in cooler areas.</p>
<h2>Soil Preparation</h2>
<p>before planting. This fertilizer contains equal amounts by weight of nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium. The fertilizer is covered with a thin layer of soil and irrigated. Cassava will grow in many soil types, but ideally the topsoil is at least 12 inches deep and not stony, shallow or waterlogged. Toxins in cassavas are typically higher in dry conditions and poor soils.</p>
<h2>Planting</h2>
<p>1.	Cassava growers plant cuttings from the stems of recently harvested plants. They typically cut 8 inches from the bottom of the stem then slice 10-inch cuttings from the next 30 inches. Cuttings are best planted as soon as possible, although they can be stored successfully in a cool, shaded place for up to 3 months. The lower half of the cuttings are planted every 3 feet in rows that are 3 feet apart. If the soil is dry, the the cuttings are planted at a 45-degree angle. If the soil is wet, they are planted vertically.</p>
<h2>Water and Fertilizer</h2>
<p>months after planting, urea -- 46-0-0 fertilizer -- is applied in a band 6 inches from the base of the plant. If the soil contains large amounts of nitrogen, continuing to add more will make the plant grow more and the edible roots grow less. In the developing world, only commercial growers typically fertilize cassava, using a balanced fertilizer. Most farmers use organic manures.</p>
<h2>Harvesting</h2>
<p>1.	Cassava is usually not harvested until at least eight months after planting. Growers dig up a sample cassava to check its size. To harvest, the stem is cut, leaving a stub as a handle to pull the cassava roots out of the ground. Harvested roots are stored in a shaded place and deteriorate rapidly.</p>
<h2>Toxins</h2>
<p>toxin that yields cyanide. Drought and potassium deficiency in the soil both increase the glucoside content in the plants. The toxin, which has a bitter taste, is removed by cooking or crushing the roots and soaking them in water.


<strong>Fertigation requirement:</strong> 90: 90 :240 kg of NPK / ha. <br>

<strong>Harvesting:</strong> <br>
Cassava is traditionally harvested by hand lifting the lower part of stem and pulling the roots out of the ground, then removing them from the base of the plant by hand. The upper parts of the stems with the leaves are usually removed before harvest. Levers and ropes can be used to assist harvesting.
