    <h2>Land preparation and sowing</h2>
    <p>Sunflower is one crop in the case of which, the season of planting are not the limiting factors. Three to four ploughing and diskings are sufficient for preparing the land. Soil should be moist at least 10cm deep before sowing and this condition necessitates good soaking rains or irrigation before sowing. Seed rate is 8-10kg of well-filled seeds per hectare. For controlling seed-borne fungal diseases, seed treatment with either Brassical or Captan @3g per kg of seed is recommended. The pre-soaking of seed for 12-24 hours ensures a rapid and high percentage of germination, an early emergence and establishment of the crop. The seed is drilled at a depth of 5cm by adopting a spacing of 45cm between rows and 30cm between plants in the row.</p>
    <h2>Fertilizers</h2>
    <p>The crop performs best when both organic and inorganic fertilizers are applied to it. The fertilizer Nitrogen:Phosphrous:Potash (NPK) schedules recommended in the case of rainfed and irrigated crops are 20:30:20 and 40:60:40 kg (NPK) of per hectare, respectively.</p>
    <h2>Irrigation</h2>
    <p>In general, for light soils 9-10 and for heavy soils 5-6 irrigations are sufficient. The critical stages of moisture requirement are germination, capitulum initiation, flowering and grain-filling</p>
    <h2>Plant protectionPest</h2>
    <p>Grasshopper (Atractomorpha crenulata F.) and Capitulum-borer (Heliothis armigera Hb).<br>
•	<strong>Control</strong> <br>
Spray or dust endosulphan 35 E.C. 1000ml in 500 litre water per hectare or dust cabaryl 10% 25kg per ha.
<strong>Diseases</strong><br>
Leaf-rust and alternaria leaf-spot <br>
•	<strong>Control</strong> <br>
Spray 0.1% of either Dithane M-45 or Dithane Z-78 <br>
<strong>Root-rot</strong> <br>
•<strong>	Control</strong> <br>
The root-rot is controlled by drenching the soil with either Brassical or

    <h2>Harvesting and yield</h2>
    <p>The sunflower crop matures in 90-100 days. The crop has to be harvested when the lower side of the head turns yellow and some of the bracts dry up. The mature heads are cut with a sickle and are dried by exposing the upper side with seeds to the sun. The well-dried heads are beaten with sticks to separate the seeds. The cleaned seed is dried well and stored in gunny bags. The sunflower crop gives a grain yield of 300-500 kg per ha under rainfed conditions and 800-1200 kg per ha when grown under irrigation.</p>
